                    Good products need to be put on in a specific order. They have a molecular weight (I took a class
                    that told me to say things like that so you'll think I'm really smart and buy more products from me)
                    and products with smaller molecules go on first so they are not sitting on top of products with
                    bigger molecules. If you don't know which order your products go on, a good rule is the thinner ones
                    first then the thicker ones. On that note….<br> Please don't buy moisturizer. It does nothing for
                    your skin. It sits on top like some fabled princess waving a wand made of unicorn tears and
                    sapphires found in Atlantis. I've heard the myth that it's like a windshield, keeping the good
                    products on your skin and the bad pollutants in the air off of your face. The problem with that is
                    that your products are not able to pack up and book flights off of your skin and everything in the
                    air is still going to stick to your face. If you love that analogy and it makes you comfortable then
                    think of your sunscreen as the new and improved windshield. The best defense for your skin is going
                    to be making it healthy. If products soak into your skin really fast your barrier is compromised and
                    you need to get it fixed with good homecare.

                    I love giving facials, I give them to my friends and family for free. They are relaxing and
                    enjoyable. As a professional I have access to products that are stronger than what you can safely
                    get (I'm looking at you Amazon who sold my client shampoo someone had filled with Nair and all of
                    her hair fell out in clumps *true story) but having stronger products isn't the end all be all of
                    skincare. I like to relate it to your teeth. A good cleaning from the dentist doesn't do much good
                    if you don't brush your teeth for the 6 months between. You can get the same results with homecare
                    that you can with treatments; it just takes more time. A lot of people look at skin care as
                    something they want to do until their current issue goes away. The problem with this mentality is
                    often the issue will come back. There are people who only touch their face when they feel they need
                    to, like a breakout. It works for some but it's usually easier to keep your skin healthy all of the
                    time than to try to get it healthy enough to fix whenever you dislike what you're seeing in the
                    mirror.

                        Every Aestheticianhas the same story. “Nothing worked until I found XXX.” XXX is the product
                        line
                        they are trying to sell you. It always has a great backstory about some golden child that had to
                        make something that worked for the good of mankind! I'm not knocking the story, here in America
                        that's how things get done. If you don't like what's out there, go and make something better.
                        Corium
                        Corrective 360 has the same story. You;ll notice I put them on all of my branding. I got
                        permission
                        to use their logo in all of my advertising. When I had a spa that logo was on my shirts, my gift
                        cards, even my bags. I'm telling you it works, but you don't need to take anyone's word for
                        anything
                        in this industry. If you have products that work for you, keep using them. If you don't, try
                        Corium.
                        I'm not selling it, so I'm not trying to make you my client. I'm telling you as someone who has
                        spent thousands and thousands on products I'll never buy another brand again. Most brands get
                        big
                        and sell out. I'm not saying that's all bad. They had a good product, we used the product, the
                        clients were happy, we made money, the brand made money. It was a win all around. The company
                        sold
                        out, the creator got a nice retirement, and we found another brand. It's a cycle and that's
                        okay. Be
                        okay with it. Corium won't sell out, because the owner has enough money to live on and her
                        priorities are not set of greed, but if this brand isn't around in 200 years it will be okay,
                        there
                        will still be decent (just not as good) products available.
