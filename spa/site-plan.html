        <h2>
            <b> Main idea </b> <br>
            People will come to this site to be educated in skincare and see options available to them. They will be
            able to see what Sbubbles Spa is all about and also get information on products. I think one of the pages
            will be for products and I'm not sure about the other one. Maybe education and false things that a lot of
            people believe. I think it would be nice to have photos of skin, products, and services. I owned a spa
            before Covid and I would like to open another spa after we move so this is a great basis for what a website
            could look like for me in a few years when I'm ready. I think the thing people really need is accessible
            information, even routines. I had a lot of people call and text me because they lost their instructions and
            even more that would get home and do things wrong. Products need to be put on in a specific order and if I
            had that order online they could look it up anytime. That convenience would really help people stay on track
            for reaching their goals. I could also have tips and tricks for people who are not interested in products or
            treatments, but are on a skin care website so they are clearly interested. <br>

            <b>Closing ideas</b> <br>
            Overall I'm really excited. I know this won't be my website, but I love skincare and the idea of putting
            together a site for something I'm passionate about is really exciting. I love the colors! I had such a fun
            time picking colors and a theme for my spa and I know doing it for my website will be fun too! <br>

            <b>Who will come to your site and why</b> <br>
            People that come to my site will be interested in skincare. They will expect me to answer questions like how
            much will this cost me and how long will it take. Unfortunately those are not ever questions we can answer.
            I will have to explain that skin is alive and it reacts differently with each person. The standard for
            someone who is rigorous with their routine can expect good results in less than a month, but hitting the
            goal of healthy skin can be a journey. <br>

            <b>What activities will be available </b> <br>
            The activities on my site will be education as well as feeling good. A spa site should make someone feel
            happy to be on. I should have clients that just like hopping on because it makes them feel good. I will also
            post new facts and things learned to keep my page relevant. I want more traffic so I need to keep people
            coming back. There will be no information necessary, I will not take payments or book appointments online.
            <br>

            <b>Why will people come to your site and why would they come back</b> <br>
            People will come to me because they are recommended to and I will get recommendations by being honest. There
            is so much that happens behind the scenes and I want to break down that wall and bring transparency into the
            industry. Not just for clients either. I have spent thousands of dollars over the years to learn what I
            know. Most of that money was wasted. I would love to spare fellow aestheticians the heartache I have gone
            through. All of the money I made from my spa went right back into education and products for my practice to
            make me better. I wish someone had told me what works and what doesn't so I didn't have to fall for every
            lie I did. I was finally in a place where I was able to pay my rent and not need more classes when I was
            shut down. This was such a big blow to me. For years I did things wrong, and now I have all of this
            knowledge that could really help people. I even had people in my Pathways class that would reach out for
            advice. By having open communication I can post new topics that come up and after a while it would be fun to
            add in a “I've never seen that” section for weird things. It would be great to have my clients have a voice
            on there too. Put quotes as well as reviews. Everyone likes to see a lot of good reviews, but it would add
            to the fun atmosphere to have conversation snippets too.

        <h3>Home</h3>

            The banner will have the logo at the top and buttons on the bottom left to the other pages. Footer will have

        <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
        <p>
            There will be a list of products and descriptions for the list. Also the banner at the bottom won't be used
            at the time because it will be for before and after pictures, but the lessons said to include things you
            will want in the future and that does seem like something that would be added later.
