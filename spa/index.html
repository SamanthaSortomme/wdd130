        <h1> Welcome to Sbubbles! I hope you will find what you are looking for. We have education and products on other
            pages, you will find the links on the bottom left of this page. Feel free to ask any questions.</h1>
        <h2>
            People will come to me because they are recommended to and I will get recommendations by being honest. There
            is so much that happens behind the scenes and I want to break down that wall and bring transparency into the
            industry. Not just for clients either. I have spent thousands of dollars over the years to learn what I
            know. Most of that money was wasted. I would love to spare fellow aestheticians the heartache I have gone
            through. All of the money I made from my spa went right back into education and products for my practice to
            make me better. I wish someone had told me what works and what doesn't so I didn't have to fall for every
            lie I did. I was finally in a place where I was able to pay my rent and not need more classes when I was
            shut down. This was such a big blow to me. For years I did things wrong, and now I have all of this
            knowledge that could really help people. I even had people in my Pathways class that would reach out for
            advice. By having open communication I can post new topics that come up and after a while it would be fun to
            add in a “I've never seen that” section for weird things. It would be great to have my clients have a voice
            on there too. Put quotes as well as reviews. Everyone likes to see a lot of good reviews, but it would add
            to the fun atmosphere to have conversation snippets too.
