                    My name is Samantha and I am very passionate about skincare.

                    I would like to be able to help you improve the condition of your skin and make sure you
                    are aware of
                    resources available. There is so much mis-information on skincare and while I can't
                    educate the whole
                    world, I can put this content out there for everyone to see.
                </h2>

                <p>
                    My goal is to bring transparency to the beauty industry.
                    As a cosmetologist I specialized in esthetics. After years of independent research
                    as well as expensive
                    classes I have learned a lot. Not just about health and how our bodies work, but
                    also about the shady
                    interworking of my beloved industry.Nothing has taught me more than experiences with
                    real people. A lot
                    of people feel taken advantage of, but in desperation they keep spending money. <br>
                    I aspire to make a site that gives you the ins and outs of skincare. If it's not
                    working, get rid of it.
                    If it is working, why are you trying to change it? Not everyone can have young skin
                    but everyone can
                    have healthy skin. The main element of beautiful skin is genetics. There really are
                    people who can do
                    very little to their skin and still look amazing. This should not be surprising, we
                    humans have a
                    variety of gifts and struggles. Outside of religion and my family nothing has been
                    as rewarding as
                    seeing the change in someone's countenance once they achieve their skincare goals.
                    Just seeing
                    improvement has given so many of my clients hope they never thought they would have.
                    A lot of people reading this will be thinking that I'm pretty good at sales, but I'm
                    really not. I have
                    just seen so many people get taken advantage of. I hope no one else ever does. .
                    <br>
                    So why should you believe me? Because I'm not trying to sell you anything. That's
                    right, I won't make a
                    dime off of this site. I'm not currently practicing so you can't become my client or
                    get skincare from
                    me, I have no paid advertisers, so this is 100% just something I feel needs to be
                    out to the public.
