                        My name is Samantha and I am very passionate about skincare.

                        I would like to be able to help you improve the condition of your skin and make sure you
                        are aware of
                        resources available. There is so much mis-information on skincare and while I can't
                        educate the whole
                        world, I can put this content out there for everyone to see.

                    <p>
                        My goal is to bring transparency to the beauty industry.
                        As a cosmetologist I specialized in esthetics. After years of independent research
                        as well as expensive
                        classes I have learned a lot. Not just about health and how our bodies work, but
                        also about the shady
                        interworking of my beloved industry.Nothing has taught me more than experiences with
                        real people. A lot
                        of people feel taken advantage of, but in desperation they keep spending money. </p>
                    <p>
                        I aspire to make a site that gives you the ins and outs of skincare. If it's not
                        working, get rid of it.
                        If it is working, why are you trying to change it? Not everyone can have young skin
                        but everyone can
                        have healthy skin. The main element of beautiful skin is genetics. There really are
                        people who can do
                        very little to their skin and still look amazing. This should not be surprising, we
                        humans have a
                        variety of gifts and struggles. Outside of religion and my family nothing has been
                        as rewarding as
                        seeing the change in someone's countenance once they achieve their skincare goals.
                        Just seeing
                        improvement has given so many of my clients hope they never thought they would have.
                        A lot of people reading this will be thinking that I'm pretty good at sales, but I'm
                        really not. I have
                        just seen so many people get taken advantage of. I hope no one else ever does. . </p>
                    <p>
                        So why should you believe me? Because I'm not trying to sell you anything. That's
                        right, I won't make a
                        dime off of this site. I'm not currently practicing so you can't become my client or
                        get skincare from
                        me, I have no paid advertisers, so this is 100% just something I feel needs to be
                        out to the public.
