            <h1> Welcome to SbubblesSpa!
                My name is Samantha and I am very passionate about skincare.
            </h1>
            <h2>
                I would like to be able to help you improve the condition of your skin and make sure you are aware of
                resources available. There is so much mis-information on skincare and while I can't educate the whole
                world, I can put this content out there for everyone to see.
            </h2>
            <p .class="colored">
                My goal is to bring transparency to the beauty industry.
                As a cosmetologist I specialized in esthetics. After years of independent research as well as expensive
                classes I have learned a lot. Not just about health and how our bodies work, but also about the shady
                interworking of my beloved industry.Nothing has taught me more than experiences with real people. A lot
                of people feel taken advantage of, but in desperation they keep spending money. <br>
                I aspire to make a site that gives you the ins and outs of skincare. If it's not working, get rid of it.
                If it is working, why are you trying to change it? Not everyone can have young skin but everyone can
                have healthy skin. The main element of beautiful skin is genetics. There really are people who can do
                very little to their skin and still look amazing. This should not be surprising, we humans have a
                variety of gifts and struggles. Outside of religion and my family nothing has been as rewarding as
                seeing the change in someone's countenance once they achieve their skincare goals. Just seeing
                improvement has given so many of my clients hope they never thought they would have.
                A lot of people reading this will be thinking that I'm pretty good at sales, but I'm really not. I have
                just seen so many people get taken advantage of. I hope no one else ever does. . <br>
                So why should you believe me? Because I'm not trying to sell you anything. That's right, I won't make a
                dime off of this site. I'm not currently practicing so you can't become my client or get skincare from
                me, I have no paid advertisers, so this is 100% just something I feel needs to be out to the public.

                <li>Most people who tell you “Nothing worked until I found XXX” are lying </li>
                <li>Not all doctors are not idiots and have shady deals with pharmaceutical companies </li>
                <li>Aesthetician's are told over and over that all clients lie and never to trust them, so <br>
                    don't be too hard on them if you are being honest and they don't take you at your word</li>
